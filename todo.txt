  board.js
------------
 * Have grid turn off with 'g', not just on.

 * Start the player's view in the middle of the board, rather than at the
   left corner.

 * Actually read in information text displayed from the game server instead of
   using static mock-up text.

 * Add mouseover information of each hex.

 * Add environment object sprites to the board.

 * When you are at the right of the board and resize window to the right, you
   go past the boundary. Fix this.

 * Allow mouse movement of the board/minimap.

 * Redo the keypress system to allow things like diagonal scrolling.


------------
  Game API
------------
 * Add authentication.

 * Based on your authentication, the available JSON data should change.

 * The clients should be able to send moves back to the game server.

 * One interaction should let players buy/sell environment objects.
