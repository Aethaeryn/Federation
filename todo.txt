 * Actually read in information text displayed from the game server instead of
   using static mock-up text.

   system, which seem to have gotten messed up by the centering and the right
   resizing revisions.

 * Add mouseover information of each hex.

 * Allow mouse movement of the board/minimap.

 * Redo the keypress system.
